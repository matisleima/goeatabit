NOTE: This application is intended to be used with a PostgreSQL local database or with a
H2 in-memory database depending on the profile chosen in the "Active profiles" input area in
Run Configurations (postgres or h2). The H2 database is configured and set up, but
a query concerning Date datatype is restricting smooth transition between PostgreSQL and H2 for now.
